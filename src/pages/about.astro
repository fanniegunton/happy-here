    <h1>About Happy Here</h1>

    <h3>Built by Locals, for Locals</h3>
    <p>
      Happy Here was created by the same team behind Takeout Tracker, the site we (Corey & Fannie) launched during the
      early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to help Austin's independent restaurants stay visible and connected to
      customers. What started as a way to support our city's food scene through crisis has evolved into a continued
      commitment to champion local bars, restaurants, and the people behind them.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Happy Here?</h3>
    <p>
      We wanted to make it easier to find great happy hour deals around town—a simple, friendly tool to help you
      discover new places or revisit old favorites without the full-price sting. Happy hour is one of the best ways to
      explore a city's food and drink culture, and we believe everyone should have a clear way to see who's offering
      specials, when, and what they include.
    </p>

    <h3>A Love Letter to the Service Industry</h3>
    <p>
      Our passion for this project is rooted in more than just a love of dining out; it's about recognizing the heart
      and hustle behind every menu, every plate, every pour. The work that goes into running a great bar or restaurant
      is enormous—hours of unseen labor, creativity, and dedication. Happy Here continues the spirit of Takeout Tracker
      by giving that hard work the respect it deserves.
    </p>

    <h3>What We Track</h3>
    <p>
      On Happy Here, "happy hour" isn't just the classic 4–6 p.m. slot. We track reverse happy hours, daily recurring
      specials (like Wine Down Wednesdays), and brunch discounts too—any regular deal you can actually plan your week
      around. To keep things simple, we have one tile for each restaurant location–just expand the arrows for details on
      specials or for more about the location itself.
    </p>

    <h3>Local-First, Always</h3>
    <p>
      We focus on locally owned businesses and Austin-born chains that have stayed true to their roots. You won't find
      big national fast-casual brands on Happy Here, no matter how many discounted apps they offer. Our goal is to
      highlight the places that make Austin unique, not just fill space with corporate names.
    </p>

    <h3>A Small Team with Big Love for Austin</h3>
    <p>
      Happy Here is a small project, built and maintained by a tiny team (technically both of us, but mostly Fannie this
      time) with a tight feature list and a lot of heart. We're adding new spots all the time and keeping things as
      up-to-date as we can. If you know a bar or restaurant we should check out—or if you spot something that needs a
      tweak—you can <a href="mailto:happyhappyhere@gmail.com">send us a suggestion</a> anytime or
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/takeouttracker/">send a DM</a>. We're always happy to hear from fellow happy
      hour hunters!
